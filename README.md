# Bing Wallpaper

This workflow shows the latest 8 wallpapers from [Bing Wallpaper](https://bingwallpaper.microsoft.com/mac/en/bing/bing-wallpaper/?brand=bing&var=1&m=1). Type `bing` into Alfred (without any arguments), press `Enter`, and it will show you the list of current wallpapers in a Grid view.

Then it allows you to:

- Press Enter to download the wallpaper and set it as your desktop image.
- Press CMD+Enter to view the wallpaper in your browser.
- Press Shift, or CMD+Y, to quicklook the image at a reduced resolution.

By default, this uses the path `~/Pictures`. If you'd like to store these somewhere else, then you will need to configure the path in `Configure Workflow...`. This will tell the scripts where you want the wallpapers to be stored on your computer.
